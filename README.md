# K-Means-Image-Compressor

This is a program that uses an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering to compress an image so that it only contains the number of colors specified by the user. This gives the image a more watercolor-y look.

The K-Means Clustering algorithm used in this program was made by yours truly. So it may not be as efficient as the sklearn algorithm, so be patient once you hit the compress button :)

I could have easily just implemented the algorithm using sklearn, but I wanted to design my own from scratch.

To use the compressor, run the executable file in dist/

I used pyinstaller to compile the script into an executable, I just included the build/ folder for reference
