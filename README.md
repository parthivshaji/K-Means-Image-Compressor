# K-Means-Image-Compressor

This is a program that uses an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called K-Means Clustering to compress an image so that it only contains the number of colors specified by the user.

The K-Means Clustering algorithm used in this program was made by yours truly. So it may not be as efficient as the sklearn algorithm, so be patient once you hit run :)

I could have easily just implemented the algorithm using sklearn, but I wanted to design my own from scratch.

To use the compressor, run the executable file in dist/
